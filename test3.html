    hi! I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for building functional and visually appealing applications.
    I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and exploring interactive design techniques. 
    Whether I'm debugging code, styling banners, or developing user-focused tools, I love solving problems creatively.
    Outside the tech world, I recharge by playing cricket and volleyball, and discovering new places.
    I'm currently honing my skills in Python and C++ to expand into software development and data handling.
